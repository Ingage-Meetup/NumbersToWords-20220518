# Numbers To Words

Write a method that takes an input of numbers and returns the number spelled out. Assume all numbers are positive and are 7 (seven?) digits or less.

## Examples  

### 1 digit  
0 = zero  
5 = five  
8 = eight  

### 2 digits  
10 = ten  
21 = twenty-one  
77 = seventy-seven  

### 3 digits  
100 = one hundred  
303 = three hundred three  
555 = five hundred fifty-five  

### 4 digits  
2000 = two thousand  
3466 = three thousand four hundred sixty-six  
2400 = two thousand four hundred  

## Bonus
Implement this additional rule: The simplest way to express large numbers is usually best.
Instead of 5300 being equal to five thousand three hundred it should return fifty-three hundred.
